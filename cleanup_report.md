## Not Removed
- `src/app/assets/react.svg` was not found and may have already been deleted or moved.

## Checks Performed
- Searched for all candidate files in code, configs, documentation, and assets.
- Verified no inbound references, imports, or usage.
- Ran Prettier for formatting.
- Ran build to verify project functionality (no errors, build succeeded).
- No test script found in package.json.

## Follow Up Items
- Consider adding tests to your project for future cleanup validation.
- Review large build chunks for optimization as noted by Vite.
