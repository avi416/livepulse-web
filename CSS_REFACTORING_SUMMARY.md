# CSS Refactoring Summary

## Architecture
- Created a standardized CSS architecture with:
  - `tokens.css`: Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, etc.)
  - `base.css`: Resets and base element styles
  - `components.css`: Reusable component styles (buttons, avatars, cards, etc.)
  - `pages.css`: Page-specific styles
  - Component-specific CSS files in `styles/components/` directory
  - Page-specific CSS files in `styles/pages/` directory

## Design System
- Implemented a comprehensive design token system with CSS variables:
  - Colors (primary, secondary, neutrals, semantic colors)
  - Typography (font family, sizes, weights)
  - Spacing and layout
  - Border radius
  - Shadows
  - Transitions and animations
  - Icon sizes
  - RGB color values for opacity adjustments

## Methodology
- Strictly followed BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology:
  - Blocks: `.sidebar`, `.search-bar`, `.button`, etc.
  - Elements: `.sidebar__nav`, `.search-bar__input`, `.button__icon`, etc.
  - Modifiers: `.button--primary`, `.sidebar__nav-item--active`, etc.
- Removed all Tailwind and inline styles
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Improved responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- Created theme-aware components with dark/light mode support
