# UI Refactoring Summary - TikTok-Style Implementation

This document summarizes the UI refactoring work done to transform the OnlineChats application into a modern TikTok-style experience for both desktop and mobile.

## Overall Approach

- Replaced Tailwind CSS with standard CSS files organized by component
- Created a comprehensive design token system with CSS variables
- Implemented responsive layouts that adapt to desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Added TikTok-style vertical feed with snap scrolling
- Created light and dark theme support with a theme toggle

## CSS Structure

1. **tokens.css** - Design variables for colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and more
2. **base.css** - Reset styles and core element styling
3. **components.css** - Reusable UI components using BEM methodology
4. **pages.css** - Page-specific layouts and styles

## Key Components Modified

### Layout Components
- **AppShell** - Main responsive layout grid with proper grid areas
- **LeftNav** - Navigation rail with Lucide icons
- **Topbar** - App bar with logo, search, and user controls
- **ActionRail** - Side panel with interaction controls
- **Mobile Navigation** - Bottom bar for mobile screens

### Content Components
- **VideoCard/LiveCard** - TikTok-style video cards with overlays
- **VerticalFeed** - Full-screen snap scrolling feed
- **FeedList** - Container for video items with infinite loading
- **LiveMeta** - Video metadata with BEM-style classes
- **LiveActions** - Interaction buttons with new styling

### UI Elements
- **UserAvatar** - Styled user avatars with fallbacks

## Responsive Design

- **Tablet** - Centered feed with hidden sidebars
- **Mobile** - Full-screen feed with bottom navigation bar

## Theme Support

- **Light/Dark Themes** - CSS variables for easy theme switching
- **Preference Detection** - Auto-detects user system preference
- **Theme Persistence** - Saves theme choice to localStorage

## Accessibility Improvements

- Added proper ARIA labels to interactive elements
- Ensured keyboard navigation works correctly
- Used semantic HTML elements
- Added focus styles for keyboard users

## Next Steps

1. Continue refactoring remaining pages (Profile, Explore, Live Hub)
2. Enhance animation and transitions for better UX
3. Further improve mobile layouts for smaller screens
4. Add additional documentation for new components

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for a modern, responsive, and accessible TikTok-style experience that works across all device sizes.
